      <h2>This Month's Featured Destination: Washington DC </h2>

Starting from $799, we have three-day trips available to our nation's capital. Price includes coach airfare, hotel shuttle, and two nights in a three-star hotel.

Don't miss this opportunity to see all the sites Washington DC has to offer: The White House, Capitol Building, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Washinton Monument, Library of Congress, and so much more!

In fact, it could take days just to see what the Smithsonian Institution has to offer. Not only are there 19 different museums and galleries, but also the National Zoo. It's the world's largest museum and nearly everything (including the zoo) is completely free!
